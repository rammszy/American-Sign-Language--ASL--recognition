# American-Sign-Language--ASL--recognition
ML

Sign language is a form of communication language designed to link a deaf-mute person to the world. To express an idea, it requires the use of hand gestures and body movement. However, the bulk of the general population remain uneducated to understand the sign language. Therefore, a translator must ease the communication. Thus, this project will aim to classify various American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets coupled in a Dataset using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve precise accuracy.
